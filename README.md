# 👁️ Real-Time Eye Closure Alert System (OpenCV + Python)

A real-time Eye Closure Alert System built using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
This project continuously detects the face and eyes using Haarcascade classifiers and triggers an alert sound when the eyes remain closed for a certain duration.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face and eye detection  
- Tracks how long eyes remain closed  
- Triggers a beep alert if eyes stay closed beyond the set threshold  
- Displays live updates on the video frame  
- Lightweight and easy to run

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Haarcascade Classifiers  
- winsound (for audio alert - Windows)

## ▶️ How to Run

### **1. Install required dependencies**

### **2. Run the script**

Your webcam will open and start detecting eyes in real time.
